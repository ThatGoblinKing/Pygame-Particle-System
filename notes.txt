- set up all colors to now take None as an option, and condensed all color defining code into one function instead of the same code over and over.
- maxVelo for colorOverVelo now defaults to self.maxVelo (dominant value), it doesn't seem to go to 100 percent and idk why.
- restructured randColor.
- set up capColor function.
- gotta fully write the docs for randColor.
